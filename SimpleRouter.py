
#In this example, we'll assume that we have a dataset containing information about web requests and #server locations. We will use a simple AI-based model to predict the best server to route each request #based on the nearest location and least utilized server. We'll use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) #algorithm for this purpose.

#First, let's import the required libraries:

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
Now, let's create a sample dataset with information about server utilization, request location, and the server to which the request was routed. Note that this is a simplified example; in practice, you would use a larger dataset with more features.

# Sample data: [server utilization, request location (latitude), request location (longitude)]
X = np.array([[10, 37.7749, -122.4194],  # San Francisco
              [20, 34.0522, -118.2437],  # Los Angeles
              [30, 40.7128, -74.0060],   # New York
              [5, 47.6062, -122.3321],   # Seattle
              [15, 41.8781, -87.6298]])  # Chicago

# Labels: server index (0-based)
y = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
Split the data into training and testing sets:

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
#Create and train the KNN classifier:

k = 3  # Number of neighbors to consider
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
#Now, let's create some sample web requests to predict the best server to route them:

# Sample web requests: [request location (latitude), request location (longitude)]
web_requests = np.array([[37.7749, -122.4194],  # San Francisco
                         [34.0522, -118.2437],  # Los Angeles
                         [40.7128, -74.0060],   # New York
                         [47.6062, -122.3321],  # Seattle
                         [41.8781, -87.6298]])  # Chicago

# Add server utilization to the requests
utilization = np.array([10, 20, 30, 5, 15]).reshape(-1, 1)
web_requests = np.hstack((utilization, web_requests))

# Predict the best server for each request
predicted_servers = knn.predict(web_requests)

# Print the predicted server indices
print("Predicted servers:", predicted_servers)
#In this example, we used the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict the best server to route each request based on server utilization and request location. This is a simple form of AI-based decision-making that can be used to optimize web request routing. In a real-world scenario, you would use a more sophisticated model and consider additional factors, such as server load, response time, and other performance metrics.
